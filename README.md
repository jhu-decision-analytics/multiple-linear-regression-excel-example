# Using Multiple Linear Regression Analysis to Predict University Innovation

In our [simple linear regression example](https://github.com/jhu-decision-analytics/simple-linear-regression-excel-example), we looked at the correlation between a college’s distribution of majors and their patents and patent citations, and then we tried to predict the “innovativeness” of a college based on the percentage of STEM undergraduate majors. This gave us some insight into how we might be able to predict a college’s innovativeness based on the percentage of STEM majors--using the number of patents as an approximation for innovation--however, outcomes usually depend on more than one variable. 

Now, we’ll create a more robust multiple linear regression analysis to look at what other variables might predict any college’s number of patents--and innovativeness--such as a school’s endowment, dollars spent on undergraduate students, and upward social mobility.
